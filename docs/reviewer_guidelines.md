Reviewing for ReScience C
=========================

Firstly, thank you so much for agreeing to review for ReScience C, we're delighted to have your help. This document is designed to outline our editorial guidelines and help you understand our requirements for accepting a submission to ReScience C.

## Guiding principles

The goal of the ReScience C reviewing procedure is to help authors to improve their submission. We expect reviewers to read the submitted articles and evaluate them for clarity and scientific correctness. This is no different from what other journals do. However, we also expect reviewers to run all submitted code, and verify that they obtain the same results as the authors, to as much precision as is technically possible. Finally, we expect authors to have a look at the code and judge if they consider it understandable.

## ReScience C Conflict of Interest Policy

The definition of a conflict of Interest in peer review is a circumstance that makes you "unable to make an impartial scientific judgment or evaluation." ([PNAS Conflict of Interest Policy](http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/coi.xhtml)). ReScience C is concerned with avoiding any actual conflicts of interest, and being sufficiently transparent that we avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest as well.

As a reviewer (or editor), COIs are your present or previous association with any authors of a submission: recent (past four years) collaborators in funded research or work that is published; and lifetime for the family members, business partners, and thesis student/advisor or mentor. In addition, your recent (past year) association with the same organization of a submitter is a COI, for example, being employed at the same institution.

If you have a conflict of interest with a submission, you should disclose the specific reason to the submissions' editor (or to an EiC if you are an editor, or to the other EiCs if you are an EiC). This may lead to you not being able to review or edit the submission, but some conflicts may be recorded and then waived, and if you think you are able to make an impartial assessment of the work, you should request that the conflict be waived. For example, if you and a submitter were two of 2000 authors of a high energy physics paper but did not actually collaborate. Or if you and a submitter worked together 6 years ago, but due to delays in the publishing industry, a paper from that collaboration with both of you as authors was published 2 years ago. Or if you and a submitter are both employed by the same very large organization but in different units without any knowledge of each other.

Declaring actual, perceived, and potential conflicts of interest is required under professional ethics. If in doubt: ask the editors.
